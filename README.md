# KRustLang
A WIP programming language made using rust.

Current Features
- Variables! Stored on the stack and can be read from and written to.
- Static type system. (Currently limited to 2 types, int and bool).
- Basic arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
- Bitwise operations (complement, and, or, xor, left and right arithmetic shift)
- Usage of parenthesis to change order of operations.
