# KRustLang
A WIP programming language made using rust.

Current Features
- Basic arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
- Bitwise operations (complement, and, or, xor, left and right arithmetic shift)
- Usage of parenthesis to change order of operations.
Yeah... it's basically a calculator.
